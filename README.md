### Project Abstract
Team Indra’s rocket, Vajra, is powered by an N3452 N-class SRAD rocket motor. Its internal frame is made from Aluminum 6061, and the aerodynamic structure combines Carbon Fibre and Glass Fibre for optimal performance. The nosecone houses a CanSat payload with a GIMBAL-controlled platform, attached via springs to withstand rocket vibrations. An onboard microcontroller ensures the platform is positioned to keep a PYRAMID object aligned with the camera’s center for tracking the entire flight. The avionics use Surface Mount Technology (SMT) components, with two microcontrollers handling tasks like data logging, apogee detection, recovery control, and airbrake activation. The flight computer supports real-time telemetry up to 16 kilometers, transmitting flight dynamics and GPS data.

### Team Introduction
Team Indra is a student-run rocketry team based in Manipal, India. We are named after one of the mightiest and strongest gods in Hindu mythology. With access to state-of-the-art resources and immense hard work, our diverse and talented team is exceptionally equipped to tackle the complex engineering challenges of rocketry. Our mission is to create a fully functional sounding rocket that reaches a height of 10,000 feet. We are dedicated to using our collective creativity and determination to fulfill our purpose and further develop groundbreaking solutions that advance the field of aerospace engineering.

### Goals
- Develop a fully functional sounding rocket.
- Achieve a flight altitude of 10,000 feet.
- Innovate in the fields of aerodynamics, propulsion, and avionics.
